These are my very first steps into programming and learning how to code. I will put every project which I am working on as a practice in this repository.
Basically creating a portfolio for myself so that I can use it to show where did I start my journey in future job interviews.
I have started to learn Python and I want to study machine learning and become a machine learning engineer in the future because it is very interesting to me and I am passionate about it.
